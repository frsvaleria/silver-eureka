      For us the tattoo is another language that is part of the art embodied in the skin, which comes from ancient
      times, which has evolved over time.
      "We believe and we are certain that the tattoo has a magical value"
    </h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="fw-light">We ventured into this world of ink, because of the passion for art that we reflect in this way,
      although the founder of trippinx tatto has more than 40 years of experience making this type of art,
      the tattoo goes back to years of the Neolithic stage, where the first signs of a human being with tattoos were
      found.
      It is a mummy from a glacier in the Austro-Italian Alps, which had a tattooed back and knees. The mummy is known
      as Ötzi,
      and is currently in the South Tyrol Museum of Archeology.
      One of the most prolific peoples in the art of tattooing is the Polynesian and the word "tattoo" comes from Tátau,
      from Samoan.
      They had the custom of tattooing their members from a very young age and as they grew, they tattooed the different
      parts of the body,
      to the point of not leaving any point of the body without tattoos. The function of this practice was to scare
      enemies.</p>



    <p class="fw-light">
      In ancient Egypt, the habit of tattooing among women stood out and in Japan they began to practice tattooing in
      the 5th century BC:
      it was a symbol of the upper social classes and they decorated their bodies with small works of art. Other
      civilizations also got tattoos,
      as an offering to their Gods.
      At present it is a totally common practice around the world with different techniques from different cultures

      However, there are cultures that have appropriated this practice in each of the continents. For example:
    </p>



    <p class="fw-light">America:Tattoos were used to honor the gods and the fallen in fighting.</p>
    <p class="fw-light">Oceania: Specifically in the Polynesian area, tattoos were body adornments used to intimidate
      the opponent in any fight.</p>
    <p class="fw-light">Asia: Tattoos were a punishment for criminals who had escaped the death penalty, being branded
      for life and excluded from social life.</p>
    <p class="fw-light">Middle East and surrounding area: Until today, it is customary to use non-permanent natural
      pigments such as henna in wedding rituals.</p>
    <p class="fw-light">The expansion of the tattoo was in the sixteenth century, when Colonel Thomas Cook exported the
      tattoo tradition to the highest spheres
      of the West after having visited the Polynesian Islands.
      Different techniques for tattooing
      Despite the modernization of tattooing techniques today, there are places where work does the same as thousands of
      years ago.
    </p>


    <p class="fw-light">
      In Japan, Tebori is practiced, a technique where the tattoo artist does everything manually. That is, it uses
      small needles attached to
      a piece of wood or metal that it holds and thus introduces the ink into the skin point by point.
      In Thailand a tattoo technique similar to Tebori is used, since a metal needle attached to one side and a thin
      piece of wood or metal is used,
      the difference lies in the length of the tool used and the level of precision with the that the movements should
      be given. Due to this process
      and the spiritual significance of the Sak Yant or 'magic tattoos', more and more Western tourists decide to leave
      a permanent ink mark on their skin after a trip to Bangkok.

      The Island of Samoa is part of the Polynesian Islands that Captain James Cook recounted about his expeditions.
      There they used tattooing materials
      that range from combs or pieces of metal to extremely sharp teeth or animal bones that are attached to a thin
      wooden stick. To get the ink to penetrate the skin,
      it is necessary for the draftsman to strike with a wider wooden stick while drawing the lines. During the whole
      process a second person must keep the skin stretched.
      This is said to be one of the most painful techniques, but being part of a culture where endurance and courage are
      measured around pain, that you cannot bear a large
      tattoo is a source of shame. In the history of tattoos, it has been given different social connotations, some
      positive and some negative, but each one is a product of its historical period.
